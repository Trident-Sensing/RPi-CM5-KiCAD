# RPi-CM5-KiCAD
Schematic symbols and footprint for Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 for KiCAD
# Notes
This repository and its symbols were updated from the repository owned by Kedarius. Thanks for your work!!

This library only contains functional representations of the CM5 interface. PRs for a connector-based symbol would be welcome.
It also has the 3D model from the official website in addition to the new recommended connectors in the 3D folder. The pathing for the 3D files will need to be adjusted for your final install.

Also, we are hiring PCB layout engineers!
